        I specialize in front-end development, focusing on creating intuitive

        expertise includes building dynamic web applications with efficient
        state management and seamless navigation. I have worked extensively on

        Beyond front-end development, I have experience in API integration and
        development, working on authentication, data security, and seamless
        third-party integrations. I have contributed to enhancing web
